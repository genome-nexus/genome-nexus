    Time-Efficient Mutational Profiling in Oncology (Tempo) is a computational pipeline for processing data of paired-end whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of human cancer samples with matched normals. Its components are containerized and the pipeline runs on the [Juno high-performance computing cluster](http://mskcchpc.org/display/CLUS/Juno+Cluster+Guide) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and on [Amazon Web Services](https://cmotempo.netlify.app/#:~:text=Amazon%20Web%20Services,opens%20new%20window)) (AWS). The pipeline was written by members of the [Center for Molecular Oncology](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/molecular-oncology).
